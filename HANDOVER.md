# windows-dictation — Living Handover Document

**Last updated:** 2026-07-09 (Kevin session) — Step 1 confirmed on both platforms; Step 2 (transcription) built, awaiting test
**Status:** Step 1 (hotkey + recording) confirmed working on Windows (7.75s capture) and Mac (19.79s capture). Step 2 (transcription) built and pushed — awaiting Kevin's test on both machines.

---

## Session 2026-07-09 (continued) — Step 1 confirmed on Mac; Step 2 built

**Mac setup hit a real environment issue, resolved:** Kevin's Mac shipped with the old Apple Command Line Tools Python (3.9.6), which has no prebuilt wheel for `pyobjc-core` (a `pynput` dependency on macOS) and failed compiling it from source — a known incompatibility (that pyobjc release is flagged "yanked" for wrongly claiming Python 3.9 support). Fix: installed Python 3.14.6 from python.org, which has prebuilt wheels for everything. `pip3.14 install -r requirements.txt` then succeeded cleanly.

**Step 1 result on Mac:** held Right Option, console reported `316584 samples, 19.79s captured at 16000Hz`. Confirmed working on both platforms now.

**Step 2 built:** `transcribe.py` — lazy-loads and caches the model on first call. `faster-whisper` (`small`, CUDA, fp16) on Windows; `mlx-whisper` on Mac, repo id `mlx-community/whisper-small-mlx` (set in `config.json`'s Mac `whisper` section, **not yet verified against the actual Hugging Face repo** — if the first run 404s trying to download, this needs correcting to whatever the real repo slug is). `main.py` now calls `transcribe()` after every recording and prints the raw transcript — no cleanup, no injection yet.

`requirements.txt` updated with platform markers: `faster-whisper; sys_platform == "win32"` and `mlx-whisper; sys_platform == "darwin"`.

**Next action:** Kevin runs `pip install -r requirements.txt` (picks up the new whisper package) then `python main.py` on **both** machines, holds the hotkey, speaks a sentence, and reports the console output — including whatever happens during the first-run model download (expect a progress bar; could take a few minutes for a few hundred MB to a couple GB). Once both are confirmed, Step 3 (Ollama cleanup pass) gets built.

## Session 2026-07-09 (continued) — Step 1 confirmed on Windows

**Result:** Kevin ran `main.py` on the Windows machine (RTX 3070), held Right Ctrl for ~8 seconds while speaking, released — console reported `123968 samples, 7.75s captured at 16000Hz`. Recording start/stop and audio capture to memory both work correctly.

**Debugging along the way (kept here for reference, not because it's still relevant):**
- First confusion was environment/working-directory related (running `python main.py` from `C:\Users\admin` instead of the cloned repo folder) — resolved.
- Added a temporary debug print on every keypress to check pynput was receiving events at all and to identify the exact key name for "Right Ctrl" on Kevin's keyboard. Confirmed `<Key.ctrl_r: <163>>` maps correctly and Left Ctrl (`ctrl_l`) is correctly ignored.
- Windows fires repeated key-down (auto-repeat) events for a physically held key — this looked like a runaway bug the first time but is normal OS behaviour; `start_recording()`/`stop_recording()` already guard against duplicate calls, so it was cosmetic only (spammed the debug log, nothing else).
- Debug logging removed once confirmed working — `main.py` is back to clean Step 1 code.
- Delivered `run-dictation.bat` (via SendUserFile, not committed to the repo — it's a personal convenience script, not part of the app) so Kevin can `cd` + `git pull` + `python main.py` with one double-click instead of typing commands each time.

**Next action:** Kevin runs the same test on the Mac (Apple Silicon) — hold **Right Option**, confirm the same kind of console output. Once both platforms are confirmed, Step 2 (transcription — faster-whisper on Windows, mlx-whisper on Mac) gets built.

## Session 2026-07-09 (continued) — Cross-platform pivot

**What happened:**
Kevin confirmed after Step 1 was first built (Windows-only) that this needs to be unified across Windows and Mac — one codebase, not two apps. Confirmed Mac hardware: **Apple Silicon**.

**Amendment recorded:** `docs/BUILD_BRIEF.md` §10 — full rationale for each component swap.

**Changes made:**
- Hotkey library: `keyboard` → **`pynput`** (the `keyboard` library doesn't work reliably on macOS)
- Default hotkey: Caps Lock → **Right Ctrl (Windows) / Right Option (Mac)** — modifier keys held alone have no OS side effects, so no key-suppression is needed (which `pynput` can't do selectively — its `suppress=True` blocks all system input, not just one key)
- `config.json` restructured with platform-keyed `hotkey` and `whisper` sections (`windows` / `darwin`), resolved by `platform.system()` in `config.py` at load time
- Whisper backend, planned for Step 2: **faster-whisper + CUDA** on Windows (unchanged), **mlx-whisper** on Mac (Metal-accelerated — faster-whisper has no Apple Silicon GPU support)
- Text injection, planned for Step 4: `pyperclip` + `pyautogui` on both; paste key `Ctrl+V` (Windows) vs `Cmd+V` (Mac); `pywin32` dropped (Windows-only)
- `main.py`, `config.py`, `config.json`, `requirements.txt`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md` all updated for the new scope

**Not done:** repo is still named `windows-dictation` — flagged to Kevin as a possible rename candidate, not renamed unilaterally.

**Next action:** Kevin tests Step 1 on **both** the Windows machine and the Mac (`pip install -r requirements.txt && python main.py`, hold Right Ctrl/Right Option, confirm console reports a sane capture duration on each). Mac needs Accessibility permission granted to Terminal first. Once both are confirmed working, Step 2 (transcription, per-platform backend) gets built.

## Session 2026-07-09 — Repo created, governance stack added

**What happened:**
- Repo `begb0037admin/windows-dictation` created (private) at Kevin's request, from `docs/BUILD_BRIEF.md` (the original build brief, committed verbatim).
- Standard governance stack added to match the estate template (`clockify` is the gold standard):
  - `CONSTITUTION.md` v2.1 — copied verbatim (cross-repo, unmodified)
  - `AGENT_MODEL.md` v2.5 — copied with local annotations only (Section 1, Section 7, Section 8 row) noting this repo runs locally on Kevin's Windows machine, not via GitHub Pages
  - `HANDOVER.md` (this file) — session record
  - `README.md` — condensed project overview
  - `CLAUDE.md` — bootstrap entry point, updated to point at the standard docs
- **Not done:** the shared `AGENT_MODEL.md` Section 8 repository table in the *other* 10 repos was not updated to list `windows-dictation`. That's a separate propagation operation across the whole estate — flag to Kevin if full cross-repo visibility is wanted.

**Next action:** Build MVP Step 1 (push-to-talk hotkey + audio capture to memory) per `docs/BUILD_BRIEF.md` §4 and §9 — build and test one step at a time, Kevin confirms each step works on his Windows/RTX 3070 machine before the next step is built.

## Architecture

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| `docs/BUILD_BRIEF.md` | Original build brief — source of truth for scope, architecture, and MVP order |
| `main.py` | Tray app entry point, hotkey listener, audio capture |
| `config.py` / `config.json` | Hotkey, model, and backend configuration |
| `transcribe.py` | faster-whisper wrapper (not yet built — Step 3) |
| `cleanup.py` | Ollama cleanup call (not yet built — Step 4) |
| `inject.py` | Clipboard + paste injection (not yet built — Step 5) |

## Key Constraints
- This is a **local Windows app** — it needs a mic, a global hotkey listener, and (ideally) Kevin's RTX 3070 GPU. Claude Code cannot run or test it directly; code is written and pushed to GitHub, then run and verified by Kevin on the admin machine.
- Build order is sequential and gated: each MVP checklist item (`docs/BUILD_BRIEF.md` §4) is tested manually on Kevin's machine before the next is built.

## Next Action
Build Step 1 of the MVP: `main.py` with tray icon + CapsLock push-to-talk hotkey + audio capture to memory (no transcription yet). Kevin runs it locally and confirms the hotkey triggers recording start/stop correctly before Step 2 (transcription) is built.
